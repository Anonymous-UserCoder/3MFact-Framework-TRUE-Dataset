    "content": "Most internet users have come across numerous fake photographs in the online world, but digitally altered videos (at least convincing ones) are a relatively new phenomenon in 2018.\n\n\n\nSo when a piece of highly edited footage purportedly showing Mark Zuckerberg announcing that he was closing the Facebook social media network started to spread online, many viewers came thinking that it might be real:\nHey everyone, Zuck here with a huge announcement. So after much consideration ... I, the Zuck man himself, will be deleting Facebook.\n\nAlthough this footage may look pretty convincing, several aspects give away that the video is a hoax.\nFor starters, this video did not originate from Mark Zuckerberg's official Facebook page, nor any other pages officially associated with the company. \nAs well, this video was created by Bayview Drive Films and was originally posted to their YouTube page on 1 April 2018 (April Fool's Day). The credits at the end of the video clearly indicated that the video was a work of a satire and was not associated with Facebook:\n\nThe language used in the video is also suspicious at best. Although Zuckerberg is occasionally mocked for being socially awkward, we highly doubt that the CEO of the social media giant would refer to himself as \"the Zuck Man\" in an official video announcing the end of an industry giant tech company.\nThis hoax video was created by taking genuine footage of Mark Zuckerberg and then digitally altering the movement of his mouth (and inserting the audio of a voice actor) to make it seem as if he were announcing the closure of Facebook. The original video was posted to Zuckerberg's official Facebook page in September 2017 and featured the CEO of Facebook talking about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election:\n\n\n\nSo when a piece of highly edited footage purportedly showing Mark Zuckerberg announcing that he was closing the Facebook social media network started to spread online, many viewers came thinking that it might be real:\nHey everyone, Zuck here with a huge announcement.

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim that Mark Zuckerberg announced in a video that he was shutting down Facebook has been rated as 'False' due to multiple pieces of evidence presented in the article suggesting the video was digitally altered and not officially associated with Zuckerberg or Facebook. The origin of the video, the language used within it, the presence of satire credits, and the manipulation of footage all indicate that the video was a hoax.",

            "reason1": "The video did not originate from any official Facebook-related pages and was instead created and posted by Bayview Drive Films on April Fool's Day, indicating that it was likely a satirical piece rather than a genuine announcement from Zuckerberg.",
            "reason2": "The language used in the video, such as Zuckerberg referring to himself as 'the Zuck Man,' is inconsistent with his usual manner of speech, raising suspicions about the authenticity of the announcement.",
            "reason3": "The discrepancies in the video, where genuine footage was manipulated to show Zuckerberg announcing Facebook's closure, emphasize the deceptive nature of the video and its lack of credibility."

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim regarding George Soros predicting Donald Trump would win the popular vote but lose due to election rigging is rated as 'False' because an altered video manipulated his original statements, presenting a false narrative. The original video transcript reveals Soros actually predicted a landslide popular vote win for Hillary Clinton, not Trump, in a non-conspiratorial manner. This manipulation created a misleading impression that contradicted the truth of Soros' statements.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The altered video falsely portrays George Soros as predicting a landslide victory for Trump in the popular vote, contrary to the truth revealed in the unedited original video where Soros clearly forecasts Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by a large margin.",
            "reason2": "By comparing the altered and original videos, it becomes evident that the manipulation was done intentionally to mislead viewers into believing Soros had made statements supportive of Trump's popular vote landslide victory, when in reality, Soros never expressed such sentiments.",
            "reason3": "The fact that the altered video quickly went viral despite its clear editing discrepancies highlights the impact of misinformation and the ease with which manipulated content can spread, leading to false perceptions and conclusions. This misrepresentation of Soros' actual statement contributed to the 'False' rating of the claim."

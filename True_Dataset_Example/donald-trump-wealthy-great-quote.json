        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim was rated 'Mostly True' because while Donald Trump did say 'you have to be wealthy in order to be great,' the full context of his statement reveals that he was discussing making America wealthy again and the importance of economic prosperity to achieve greatness, not implying that individual wealth equates to personal greatness. The rating takes into account the nuances of Trump's statement and how it related to his broader message on national wealth and addressing economic issues.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "Donald Trump did mention 'you have to be wealthy in order to be great,' but the additional context provided in the article clarifies that he was connecting wealth to national prosperity, not implying a direct correlation between personal wealth and individual greatness. This evaluation considers Trump's overall message in the speech and the intent behind his words, leading to a nuanced understanding of his statement.",
            "reason2": "The discussion of 'making America wealthy again' and addressing economic concerns like the 'stealth tax' on energy, which Trump vowed to eliminate, further supports the 'Mostly True' rating. The connection between wealth, national economic policies, and Trump's goal as President to enhance the country's financial standing aligns with the broader context of his statement and his policy objectives.",
            "reason3": "The mention that the video with the partial quote circulated on social media under the hashtag #GreaterThanTrump highlights the importance of considering the wider dissemination and interpretation of Trump's words. Despite the partial nature of the clip, the surrounding details and explanations in the article help to elucidate the true meaning behind Trump's statement, supporting the 'Mostly True' rating when viewed in its entirety."

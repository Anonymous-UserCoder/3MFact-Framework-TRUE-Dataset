    "rating": "False",
    "content": "A video featuring crowds of people \"interacting\" with virtual animals was shared on Facebook in February 2017 along with a message claiming that the footage showed a \"7D Hologram Park\" in Japan, where visitors can touch, feel, and even smell these digital creations. The video features clips from a variety of locations:\n\nThe \"animals\" shown in this video were not part of a virtual zoo or a '7D' hologram exhibit, but instead are part of an advertising campaign for National Geographic that was reappropriated and made into a viral video.\nIn 2011, National Geographic teamed up with the British digital advertising agency Appshaker to create an \"augmented reality\" exhibit in various malls:\nWe built the animated content using Maya (film industry standard animation software), with the movements and mannerisms mimicking actual animal footage in the wild. The content and the sound was optimized for the shopping mall environments and our system then locks and matches the floor marker, allowing us to know exactly where the physical content sits in relation to people. This creates a \"content channel\" where all the action is.\nAlthough the footage appears to show people interacting with these virtual animals, Appshaker's setup does not use holograms. The animals were projected onto a screen, where they appeared to be in close proximity to the filmed audience. A \"behind the scenes\" video offers a closer look at the setup:\n\nAnother video we found further explains how this type of exhibit is made:\n\nMost of the footage in the viral Facebook clip can be found on the Appshaker web site. The one exception appears to the the video's final segment, which purportedly shows a \"7D\" hologram whale \"splashing\" children in a gymnasium. That clip was created by a different company, Magic Leap, and we debunked it here. \n ",

        "synthesized_rationale": "The claim about a 7D hologram park in Japan featuring virtual animals that can be touched is rated as 'False' because the video circulating on Facebook of people interacting with these animals was part of an advertising campaign for National Geographic and not a hologram exhibit. The animals were just projections on a screen, not actual holograms as claimed in the video.",
        "detailed_reasons": {
            "reason1": "The video misrepresented an augmented reality exhibit in malls by National Geographic and Appshaker as a '7D Hologram Park', where the animals shown were not real holograms but projections on a screen.",
            "reason2": "The setup by Appshaker did not involve holograms; instead, they used normal screens to project animals that were filmed to mimic authentic animal behavior. There was no tangible interaction with holograms as the claim suggested.",
            "reason3": "Contrary to the claim, the '7D hologram whale' splashing children in a gymnasium was also debunked as not a hologram but a different type of projection by Magic Leap. This debunking discredits the notion of a 7D hologram park with touchable virtual animals.",
            "reason4": "The behind-the-scenes videos and explanations clearly show that the setup relied on screens and digital projections, not advanced holographic technology that allows physical interaction with virtual elements."
